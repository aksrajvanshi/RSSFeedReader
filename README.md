# RSSFeedReader

This project is developed for reading a RSS Feed link and a replacing a word in the feed. It is done for a coding assignment and I tried to make changes to make it easy to read and reuse. I tried implementing the SRP (Single Responsibilty Principle). However, it might have a lot of things to improve upon (like Dependency Injection, code reusability and some other useful design patterns) and the suggestions are welcome.
